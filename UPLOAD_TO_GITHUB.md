## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Make Repository Public
- Private repos need GitHub Pro ($4/month)
- Public repos get free Actions
- Your code will be visible (but that's okay!)

### Include .github Folder
- This has the build workflow
- Without it, no automatic builds!
- Make sure it's uploaded

### Wait for Build
- First build: 6-8 minutes
- Don't close browser
- Watch progress in Actions tab

---

## 🔧 If Something Goes Wrong

### Build Fails?
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click failed build
3. Read error message
4. Common fixes:
   - Re-upload missing files
   - Check pubspec.yaml
   - Ensure android folder uploaded

### Can't Upload Files?
- Try smaller batches
- Or use Git Desktop app
- Or use Git command line

### No Actions Tab?
1. Go to Settings
2. Click Actions
3. Enable Actions

---

## 💡 Alternative: Git Desktop (Easy GUI)

If drag-and-drop doesn't work:

1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Install it
3. Clone your repository
4. Copy project files to folder
5. Commit and push
6. Done!

**Even easier than website!**
